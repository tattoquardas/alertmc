                    Learn from feedback. Time and again this has shown itself to be of crucial 
                    importance for the personal and professional development of managers. Feedback 
                    from people from within the immediate surroundings is indeed immeasurably 
                    valuable. Of course it is also important that the feedback comes from different 
                    angles. Alert 360° lists the reactions from superiors, colleagues and direct reports, 
                    so that you are presented with an overall picture. This way you can evaluate your 
                    own way of management, or act as coach in accompanying others in a 
                    development plan.

                    Depending on your requirements, Alert 360° allows you to opt for a standard 
                    package, or for a version adapted in accordance with needs. The standard package

                    the tailor-made instrument, you have the possibility of indicating yourself which 
                    skills are of importance to you and of creating a 360° report that reflects your own 
                    competencies. In this way Alert 360° provides you with a report which has been 
                    designed for your specific situation.

                <br>• <i><b class="localize">Clear overview</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    The feedback report consists of two main sections. First the results are 
                    discussed in connection with a number of competencies which managers 
                    need in order to be efficient leaders. After this, problems are cited which 
                    might potentially lead to failure.
                </p>
                
                • <i><b class="localize">Detailed</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    The feedback report goes from global to specific. First the average scores per 
                    scale are seen. Then each scale is split up per assessment group and per item.
                </p>
                
                • <i><b class="localize">Confidential</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    Only the manager being evaluated receives the results. That person
                    him/herself decides if he or she wishes to share the data with others.
                </p>
                
                • <i><b class="localize">Anonymous</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    It is not possible to derive from the report which feedback comes from which 
                    colleagues or direct reports. Their anonymity is carefully preserved. Only 
                    feedback given by a superior may not necessarily be confidential.

                    Alongside the report you will also receive a concise guide which acts as a
                    key to analyzing the report. This guide will help you to review the feedback 
                    and to identify potential areas of further development.
