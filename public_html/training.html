                    Of course, to guarantee optimum results, we need to ensure that everyone who uses AMC instruments has received the proper training. Our tests and questionnaires can be used for a variety of purposes, including selection, promotion, personal development and staff coaching. This means their results can have a major impact on both individuals, teams, and – in the longer run – even the organisation as a whole. That is why as their developer, we are morally obliged to constantly improve these instruments in terms of quality and precision, and to guarantee the most effective transfer of knowledge at all times. In turn, we expect professionals who have been accredited by AMC to keep educating themselves, so that they can use the wealth of information generated by our tests and questionnaires as effectively as possible. This continuous drive for quality is something that we attach strong importance to within our organisation.
