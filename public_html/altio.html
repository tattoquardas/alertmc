                    The Altio is a questionnaire based on the Myers-Briggs Indicator that gives insight into the type of an organisation. 
                    It is often thought that the culture or style of an organisation is the sum of the different staff members within that organisation. 
                    It turns out not to be completely true. Each organisation has its own character, often resembling the human character. 
                    Think on natural differences between organisations with the same line of business.

                        Therefore it is important to identify both – types of people and type of the organisation in order to work together successfully and to create a successful organisation.
                        Like the MBTI, Altio is offering a common language for its users in order to understand the organisation and the way it works. 
                        Altio points out strengths and weaknesses in a non-judgemental way. 
                        And as in MBTI, there are organisations in typical areas, like we find people in typical professions. 
                        In some organisations it’s the line of business who is influencing its type. Clear examples we find in the public sector or in the military field.
                </p><br>
                Altio creates a valid picture of the type of an organisation, with its own typical characteristics based on the four dimensions of the MBTI:
