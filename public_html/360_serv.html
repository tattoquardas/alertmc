                    As a manager, one of the most valuable things you can receive is targeted feedback. And when it comes from a variety of sources and is generated by a carefully-considered questionnaire, it becomes even more valuable as input for your professional growth. Over the past few decades, the 360° feedback cycle has established itself as a well-known method for gaining concrete, systematic feedback from your immediate professional environment.
