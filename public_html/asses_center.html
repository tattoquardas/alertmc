                    To optimally tailor the assessment process to your wishes, we will first organise a preparatory 
                    interview. During this interview, we make a clear inventory of your wishes, requirements and 
                    expectations. We can either take your organisation’s existing competence model as a point of 
                    departure. Or we can develop a custom set of Assessment Centre exercises that are aligned as closely as 
                    possible to the actual demands of the position and your organisation. During this interview, we will 
                    also confer with you to determine the best reporting format for the assessment results.
