                    The coaching and tele-coaching services provided by Alert Management Consultants are structured
                    in consultation with the client and carefully tailored to his or her needs. While face-to-face coaching 
                    sessions (which usually last 60 to 90 minutes; to a maximum of 2 hours) have proven most effective, 
                    it may be necessary to conduct some sessions via telephone or webcam to accommodate restrictions 
                    posed by the client’s work-related or private circumstances. Sessions will be held as far as possible 
                    outside the client’s regular work environment.

                <br><p class="localize">
                    The coaching programme focuses on the development and implementation of strategies that help 
                    the client to achieve goals that the individual has set for him- or herself in relation to professional 
                    performance or personal fulfilment. The coaching may centre on specific personal projects, work-life 
                    balance, job performance or job satisfaction, or on more general circumstances in the client’s 
                    personal life, business or field. A variety of methods and techniques may be used during coaching, 
                    including personal strategic planning, values clarification, brainstorming, motivational counselling 
                    and other instruments. The main objective is to develop new strategies that allow the participant to 
                    successfully cope with specific challenges, as determined at the beginning of the coaching 
                    programme in consultation with the various parties involved (stakeholders).   
                </p>
                <br><p class="localize">
                    Throughout the coaching process, the different stakeholders are expected to contribute to a 
                    constructive coaching experience and outcome, to work towards building trust and to respect all 
                    agreements made with regard to accountability and confidentiality. As a client, you determine which 
                    aspects will be focused on. The programme’s success depends in part on your willingness to take 
                    risks and try new approaches. The coach-client relationship is relatively candid and challenging. Your 
                    coach strives to be honest and straightforward, to ask incisive questions and to keep challenging you 
                    to move forward. Over the course of the coaching programme, you will be asked to evaluate which 
                    progress has been made so far. If you are unsatisfied with any aspect of the coaching process, please 
                    notify me as soon as possible so that we can take joint steps to correct the problem.

                    This comprehensive assessment programme starts with a half-day, face-to-face session, during which 
                    we make an inventory of the client’s present situation (strengths/weaknesses, style, personal values 
                    and motives, etc.), the requirements of his or her current position and the complex organisational 
                    dynamics in which he or she operates. The Assessment Centre programme includes exercises like an 
                    in-basket test with observers, as well as an analysis of the Koan-PI Personality Test.
