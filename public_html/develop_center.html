                    A Development Centres (DC) serves a similar purpose to an Assessment Centre, in that it is used to 
                    determine the individual’s specific strengths and weaknesses. However, in a Development Centre, the 
                    focus is on which competences the candidate could build on to accelerate his or her professional 
                    development.

                <p class="localize">
                    The programme ultimately yields a Personal Development Plan (PDP) that includes recommendations for 
                    the individual’s future growth. The objective is to consistently stimulate the candidate to improve his or 
                    her skills and strive towards further growth and success in his or her career. The Development Centre also 
                    results in a custom Plan of Action, which is drawn up by the candidate him- or herself – with support from 
                    Alert Management Consultants.

                    Alert Management Consultants helps organisations to set up and implement a Development Centre for
                    their staff – as well as the associated follow-up actions. This support is offered in the context of:
                    <div class="localize">- The progression of management team members to a higher level</div>
                    <div class="localize">- The identification of high-potential candidates who can be appointed to complex positions of responsibility, or in the context of a management development programme.</div>
                    <div class="localize">- Strength/weakness analyses of organisations’ members of staff: mapping out the domains in which the
                    candidate is relatively strong, as well as the areas in which he or she needs to be supported, redirected or coached.</div>
                    <div class="localize">- Career development programmes that are geared towards helping employees to reposition their career within the organisation.</div>

                <br><br><b>.1. <i class="localize">Preparatory interview</i></b>
                <p class="localize">
                    To optimally tailor the assessment process to your wishes, we will first organise a preparatory interview.
                    During this interview, we gain a concrete picture of your wishes, requirements and expectations. We will 
                    also jointly determine the best reporting format for the assessment results at this stage.
                </p>
                <br><b>2. <i class="localize">Development Centre</i></b>         
                <p> 
                    A Development Centre may consist of the following elements:
                    <br> - <b>360°Feedback:</b> <span class="localize">This element is based on a survey held within the candidate’s immediate professional
                    environment (colleagues, managers, team members). The survey yields quantifiable data regarding the 
                    candidate’s performance in the context of his or her existing position.</span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">Personality Test (KOAN-PI):</b> <span class="localize"> Provides insight into how likely it is that the candidate will demonstrate
                    specific competences in future roles. </span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">Facet Intelligence Test:</b> <span class="localize"> Provides insight in the candidate’s capacity to solve numerical and verbal.</span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">In-basket test with roleplaying:</b> <span class="localize"> Provides insight in the candidate’s handling of complex situations, how
                    he or she takes decisions and sets priorities, and whether the candidate has the potential to effectively 
                    handle roles specific to the position.</span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">Interview:</b> <span class="localize"> Provides insight in the extent to which the candidate has already demonstrated particular competences in the past.</span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">Group exercise:</b> <span class="localize"> This element can be included in the Development Centre programme if different employees from the same organisation will be taking part in a DC on the same day.</span>
                    <br> - <b>ALTI / MBTI:</b> <span class="localize"> If the commissioning company already uses this self-report questionnaire within its own
                    organisation, it may be useful to include it in the DC programme. Another instrument frequently used in 
                    the context of career- and performance-related questions is ALTI. Knowing the candidate’s psychological 
                    type can help create added value. In view of the descriptive nature of these instruments, ALTI and MBTI 
                    should not be used within programmes that are strictly geared towards selection or promotion.</span>
                    <br> - <b class="localize">Feedback (mandatory):</b> <span class="localize"> At the end of the session, we provide the candidate with extensive personalised feedback regarding his or her performance.</span>
                </p>

                <br><b>3. <i class="localize">Communication of results</i></b>
                <p class="localize">
                    The results of all Development Centre elements will be communicated to you by means of an extensive
                    report. We will consult with you beforehand to jointly determine the precise reporting format. Naturally, 
                    this report will be treated with strict confidentiality, and we will fully respect the ownership of the various 
                    details contained within.

                <p class="localize">The following chart provides an example of a typical Development Centre sequence. As stated earlier, this 
                sequence can be tailored to your specific wishes and requirements.</p>

                <p class="localize">Before taking part in the DC itself, candidates are asked to fill in various online questionnaires (KOAN-PI, 
                ALTI and 360°). The completed questionnaires need to be submitted to Alert Management Consultants at 
                least 2 days prior to the DC itself.</p>
