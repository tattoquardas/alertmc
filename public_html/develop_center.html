                    A Development Centres (DC) serves a similar purpose to an Assessment Centre, in that it is used to 
                    determine the individual’s specific strengths and weaknesses. However, in a Development Centre, the 
                    focus is on which competences the candidate could build on to accelerate his or her professional 
                    development.

                    The programme ultimately yields a Personal Development Plan (PDP) that includes recommendations for 
                    the individual’s future growth. The objective is to consistently stimulate the candidate to improve his or 
                    her skills and strive towards further growth and success in his or her career. The Development Centre also 
                    results in a custom Plan of Action, which is drawn up by the candidate him- or herself – with support from 
                    Alert Management Consultants.

                        also jointly determine the best reporting format for the assessment results at this stage.

                            environment (colleagues, managers, team members). The survey yields quantifiable data regarding the 
                            candidate’s performance in the context of his or her existing position.</span>

                            the context of career- and performance-related questions is ALTI. Knowing the candidate’s psychological 
                            type can help create added value. In view of the descriptive nature of these instruments, ALTI 
                            should not be used within programmes that are strictly geared towards selection or promotion.</span>
