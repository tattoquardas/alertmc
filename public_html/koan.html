                        As well as others in your field of expertise, you might sometimes find it difficult to completely assess someone's personality. 
                        Indeed, it is not a simple task to gain insight into a candidate's or employee's personality. 
                        In order to simplify this process for you, the KOAN-Personality Indicator (KOAN-PI) was developed. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="localize">
                        This empirically based personality questionnaire helps you, for instance, to assess someone's personality and character, 
                        and to make the best choice when recruiting and selecting the right candidate for the right job.
