                   The Alert Type Indicator (ALTI) is a psychological instrument that helps you increase your insight into your own psychological make-up and that of others. It allows you to discover your personal strengths and unique talents. The instrument also deals with domains that you may want to develop further. ALTI can make a significant contribution to your personal development and stimulates growth opportunities in the very broadest sense of the word. An interesting side-effect of this increased self-knowledge is that you find it easier to understand what drives those around you. You are able to empathise with behaviour that previously annoyed you, for example, leading to more productive collaborations.

                <i class="localize">
                    Imagine you like to prepare everything well in advance. You draw up a clear agenda for an upcoming meeting and make sure it is distributed to everyone who will be participating. If
                    people start deviating from this agenda during the meeting in
                    question, you may find this annoying. In contrast, others may
                    actually be irritated by strict adherence to the agenda items.
                    It is impossible, in other words, to organise a meeting that it is
                    perfect for everyone involved. Instead of becoming annoyed by
                    this ‘mismatch’, you can also use it to your benefit. The type
                    theory can help you in this process.

                            take the individual’s knowledge and skills on board.

                            Consultants developed the ALTI questionnaire on the

                            instrument is subject to on-going evaluation and finetuning
                            – meaning that every year, it becomes even
                            more effective and precise.
