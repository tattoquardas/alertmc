                Consultants (AMC) has been active in a variety of HRM domains from the very outset. Innovation and research are in our genes,
                and our motto has always been </span>

                <p class="localize"> 
                    In the mid-1990s, AMC started performing targeted, empirical
                    research to gain input for the development of various proprietary
                    personality tests, and specifically the Koan-PI personality test.
                    Over the years, we have added a number of other HRM
                    instruments, including ALTI, which yields a reliable measurement
                    of 16 Psychological Types; Alert360°, an extensive platform with
                    360° feedback questionnaires and the associated reports; PolyGlot
                    language tests, the Facet capacities test and a collection of In-
                    basket Exercises. Our clients use these instruments – to their
                    considerable satisfaction – for a variety of purposes, including
                    selection, personal development, leadership development and
                    team building. Our questionnaires and reports can be accessed
                    online. As far as training is concerned, we offer a wide range of in-house programmes, courses and workshops on all sorts of themes,
                    including team building, communication, performance
                    management and behavioural interviews. A number of our
                    programmes use MBTI theory or Psychological Types as a point of
                    departure. And finally, we offer accreditation trainings for the
                    users of our various HRM instruments.

                    <br>In terms of HRM advisory services, AMC can offer your
                    organisation concrete support and recommendations in the areas
                    of coaching, assessment &amp; development centres, 360° feedback
                    and career counselling. In each case, you have the choice of two
                    options: we can either teach you how to handle the
                    implementation and management process in-house, or you can
                    ask us to handle it on your behalf.
                <p class="localize">
                    <br>In addition, you can take advantage of our extensive competence management experience. 
                    We can help you to effectively incorporate competences and talent development within your own HRM programmes. 
                    But you can also turn to us to set up a tailored competence management project for your organisation.
