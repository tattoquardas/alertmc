                    Language is vital. No doubt you will agree. This is of course seen in the overwhelming success of all kinds of language courses. On a personal level, we hear of countless people just about to go on holiday quickly going to the library to borrow a dictionary of the language of the place they are going to. On a professional level, languages are naturally of prime importance to organizations with premises in different countries. But even for national organizations linguistic ability is invaluable for external communications.

                        But how can you get an exact picture of someone’s linguistic ability? From a conversation alone, for example, you can have no idea of the level of someone’s written language. How can you discover what level someone is at in a particular language? And how can you be sure that he has an adequate command of his mother tongue? How can you best evaluate someone’s linguistic ability in recruitment or after a language course?

                <i><b class="localize">Foreign Language Tests</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    It is very likely that when you think of language tests it is foreign languages that first come to mind. That is quite logical. Indeed it speaks for itself that we find foreign languages more difficult than our mother tongue. That is also why it is mainly ability of foreign languages which tends to be tested. PolyGlot therefore offers tests for non-native speakers in Dutch, French, English and German. These allow you simply and quickly to obtain a picture of someone’s ability in a foreign language.

                <i><b class="localize">Mother Tongue Tests</b></i>
                <p class="localize">
                    Linguistic ability is becoming more and more appreciated in our modern society. Mother tongue ability can certainly not be overlooked in this. For numerous positions where both spoken and written language are important - think of project managers, secretaries, etc. -, mother tongue ability is of prime importance, and it is by no means self-evident. PolyGlot therefore also includes language tests which indicate the degree of a person’s command of their mother tongue.
